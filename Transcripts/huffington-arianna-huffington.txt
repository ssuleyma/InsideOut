I was two years into building HuffPost. A divorced mother of two teenage 
daughters, anybody listening with teenage daughters knows what that means, and had 
fallen complete prey to the delusion that in order to succeed as an entrepreneur and as 
a mother, I just had to sacrifice myself.That morning when I stood up from my desk to go get a sweater – I remember because I was cold – I collapsed and hit my head on my desk, broke my cheekbone. That was this amazing wake up call that I'm incredibly grateful for right now, because it led me to trying to understand why that happened.​ Part of what led me to try and to understand this is that when something like that happens, you go through a battery of medical exams because they don't know what's wrong with you. Do you have a brain tumor? Do you have a heart problem? Literally, at the end of it, I felt like if this was a movie, all my doctors in white coats would come together and look at me and say, "Arianna, you have civilization's disease: burnout. There is nothing the medical profession can do for you. You have to go and change your life."  
Being a research-driven person, I read, I studied, I talked to scientists. I came to this 
really profound realization that hundreds of millions of people around the world are living under this delusion. We're actually living believing something false. It's like we're living at a time when we thought the Earth was flat. When you believe something false, a lot of bad things follow, like the laws of navigation were all wrong at the time. The laws by which we navigate our lives are all wrong right now. It's a very, very, very profound belief. It's not easy to shake. 
​Right now, we still talk about work-life balance, which I think is just not 
the right way to address this problem. Because it's not like work and life are at opposing 
ends. That, in fact, they rise and fall in tandem. We need to get away from this idea of 
the trade-off.  
​When in 2007, I collapsed from exhaustion and burnout – that was two 
years into building the Huffington Post – and I started appreciating other things like sleep and recharging, et cetera. I launched the dedicated sleep section in 2007. I remember having a board meeting and my board being appalled at that. It's hard to go back to 2007 and see how disrespected sleep was. There was no way you would ever see an issue 
about sleep in the Wall Street Journal or the Harvard Business Review – which is now a 
regular place to find these conversations.  That night, Jack had a speaker's dinner. During that dinner, he said to me, "If I were you, I would leave the Huffington Post and launch a new company around Thrive. Because there is no market leader and the biggest crisis going on in China is the mental health crisis induced by stress – over 100 million people suffering from mental health problems." We are having this conversation at his tai chi center. He's very steeped in the Chinese culture of the Tao, Lao Tzu, just the whole idea of Yin Yang. Yang is you go out, you achieve, you conquer, you build your startup. Yin is you come back and refuel.
Honestly, Reid, it was amazing when I look back because when he said that, all I could do was try to be extremely polite and like I’m thinking this is a crazy idea but thank you so much, whatever. Like I absolutely did not have a single thought of ever doing what he said. I became more and more involved in this topic and speaking more and more about it and seeing how real the need was to actually change the culture, to change how people were working and living. I mean 75% of healthcare causes and healthcare problems are stress-related and preventable. Seventy five percent!  The Huffington Post is about everything. Thrive is about only one thing: How do we build our best lives? How do we achieve everything we want without burnout and stress, bringing together ancient wisdom, the latest science, and new role models? Reid, I'm going to get you to write something about the good things you are doing. There is a McKinsey study that was accepted at the Harvard Business Review and the headline was basically, The Importance of Sleep in the Quality of 
Leadership. At first, when you read that, you think it's an Onion headline. When you look 
at the authors being a McKinsey sleep specialist. I mean, the idea that McKinsey has a 
sleep specialist sounds like an Onion headline. Yet, there is this now purely scientific 
way of looking at what happens to our frontal lobes and our cognitive decision making, 
when we are sleep deprived or running on empty for whatever reason. I can trace back all my hiring mistakes to being tired, which has the impact not just of impairing your cognitive abilities to make the right decisions but also subconsciously of making you want to say yes. When you are running on empty, you're overwhelmed by your to-do list. What we are doing now at Thrive, having learned from my mistakes, we have this rule that nobody should interview while tired. Those with children who are listening to the broadcast know that you don't just drop your baby or your young child to bed. You lower the lights, you give them a bath, you read them “Goodnight Moon”, you sing them a lullaby. Why are you doing that? Because children and adults need a transition to sleep. 
I did a parody of “Goodnight Moon” on Audible called “Goodnight Smart Phone”: “Goodnightdark room, g​oodnight moon which I can’t see because of my blackout 
curtains​ but which I know is there. ​Goodnight sleep-killing blue light from my electronic 
devices which I have gently escorted out of the bedroom.​ And goodnight red balloon.” 
The point of that is you need to say goodnight to your day, goodnight to all your 
problems, your projects, and all the things you are excited about, not just the problems. 
Thrive is not a company where you don't occasionally pull an all-nighter 
or exert yourself because you are meeting a deadline. It's a company. When that 
happens, you immediately take time for yourself. We call that Thrive time, Thrive days, 
whatever you need to completely refuel. The problem that creates the casualties that are 
proliferating around us, it's the fact that you don't quickly course correct. People never 
have a problem with that they do occasionally. It's what's expected of you every day 
that's the problem. There were some people at the beginning who joined the company 
thinking that this was an opportunity to chill under the mango tree. Clearly, these were 
not right for the company because we're not chilling under the mango tree. We are 
growing very fast. We are working hard. We're just not working stupidly. Because 
working long hours is not working smart once you start having diminishing returns.  
He told his young children, "Daddy is going to take you to the playground." One of them said, "Oh no, can’t the babysitter take us?" He was crestfallen and asked why. The little boy said, "Because when you're at the playground, you're always on your phone."  
We actually catch each other, we laugh at each other, when we catch ourselves going back to the very culture we are trying to change. We have what we call in our culture of values “the entry interview”. In the entry interview, we ask people, "What's important to you outside your work?" At one of our Accenture trainings, for example, a woman said, "What's really important to me is to take my daughter to school at 7:30 every morning but my manager sets up 7:30 in the morning conference calls every morning." 
We talked to her manager. Her manager said, "It's not a problem to have the calls at 
8:00. I didn't know if you wanted to take her kid to school at 7:30." There may be a day 
when she will have to have a 7:30 conference call, that won't matter. What matters is, 
what can she do every day? The entry interview is also something that helps build a 
team spirit because even though that's important to you, I'll look at you a little differently. I want to know about your daughter, if it's important for you to go to your 3:00pm violin class once a week, whatever it is. We begin to know each other beyond work. 
Call centers are one of the most stressed populations and also one with the highest attrition.Through machine learning, you know when an operator has received a 
particular nasty customer call which is going to make them be not as good on the next 
call and which is going to increase their stress. Their next call which they expect to be 
another angry customer is a Thrive call that lasts under a minute – could be 30 seconds, 
45 seconds, or 60 seconds because neuroscience tells us it takes under 60 seconds to 
course correct from stress. The call may say, “Remember three things you are grateful 
for in your life”, “Stand up and stretch”, “Take some deep breaths”, very simple things. 
I believe we have an incredible opportunity to use technology for healthier lives. We need to very consciously create boundaries around what is sacred and most important to us. We actually developed an app, the Thrive app, which addresses that. When you put your phone on Thrive mode in order to have a meal with your wife or your friends uninterrupted or do deep work, if I text you, I'll get a text back that says, “Reid is in Thrive mode until such and such are done.” It's by direction, which is very important, because that's also in a way to change the culture.  
Right now, the expectation is that Reid is so amazing, he responds quickly, he's always 
on. We want to change that to Reid is so amazing and has such a clear sense of what's 
important in his life, that he can also disconnect. The second thing that it does, it gives you a dashboard of your social media, game, et cetera, consumption during the day, 
which surprises people. You spend two hours on Instagram today or three hours on 
Candy Crush or binge watching Netflix, whatever. Then, it asks you if you want to set 
limits. If you do, it sends you notifications. Let's say you say, “I only want to spend an 
hour-and-a-half on Instagram”, it cuts you out at an hour-and-a-half for this one day. This is an example of technology helping you navigate your relationship with technology. 
You can tell people, ”You don't have to answer emails after hours. If it's 
urgent, we'll contact you.” That doesn't matter. People can still get super stressed unless they learned two things. One is to relentlessly prioritize. Two, to be comfortable with incompletions. Relentlessly prioritize is key. Nobody can do anything important, let alone thrive if they don't learn what's really important, what I have to get done, and what is not important.  
The second step is that there isn't anybody in any interesting job who can complete 
everything they could have possibly done that day. If you are the kind of person who 
thinks “I haven't done everything” and therefore moves into stress, it doesn't matter what 
your company says, it's an internally induced stress. Our whole B2B is based on the 
behavior change platform, broken down into science-based micro steps for change, the 
most important micro step in learning to live with incompletions is declaring an arbitrary 
end to your day. You have to declare it. You have to ... 
This is the end of my day. Because human beings learn through ritual, we recommend that you declare the end to your day by turning off your phones, iPods, laptops and gently escorting them out of your bedroom. And wake up in the morning and have a minute, that's another micro step. Take a minute to remember what you are grateful for, set your intention for the day before you go to your phone. Over 70% of people sleep with their phones. The first thing they do is go to their phone. If you think of it, our phone is everybody else's agenda for us. Our bodies are flooded with the cortisol stress hormone before we have even gotten out of bed. These are small changes, small microscopic changes that can have a huge impact. That's what is so wonderful. That's why I'm so optimistic. These are not huge changes. We are not asking people to leave their jobs or move to a Caribbean island. Yeah, chill under the mango tree. We ask them to take these small micro steps.
