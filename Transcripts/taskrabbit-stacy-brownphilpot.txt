I grew up on the west side of Detroit. It wasn't the best neighborhood, it wasn't the worst neighborhood, but people looked out for each other. Of course, later on, things got worse for a lot of people very, very fast, but it was home for me. We would deliver the papers in the mornings, and then on the weekends we had to go collect from people. Of course, there was always people who didn't want to pay, so I had to make sure we got paid.  Oh, I was about 10 years old. Well, you just knock on their door a lot, and often, and then you kind of watch when people's cars would pull up, and see them going in the house, and you run out and catch them before they close the door. And then I'm 10, so of course they're going to look at me and say, "I need to give Stacy her money." But sometimes they just wouldn't answer the door if they didn't have it, so you have to watch people when they go into their house. 
Some people would see us and it's like, four degrees outside, and they would just give us that extra dollar. That just meant so much, because I know it came from people who didn't have a whole lot of money, but they were proud of us for doing real work, good work, legal work, in a community where a lot of people did illegal work to make money. I think that helped inspire me probably later on, that if you do good work for good people, it'll pay off. I liked to buy candy. 
I would say that my upbringing in Detroit taught me grit. It taught me about not just the cold weather, but there's a community that needs to thrive, and you need to figure out a way. Thirteen interviews later, I decided that this was probably one of the best set of people I've ever met in my whole life, and that these are the kind of people I want to learn from. I said, "Sheryl, I think we need to create a network for black people, and I really think we should just recruit more, and you've done a lot of stuff with women," and she'd already really advocated a lot of things around women, so, "Can you help me with this?" She said, "No, because I'm not black, and you are the person that needs to do it." She said, "Stacy, at one point you have to realize that you're the person that we've been waiting for to make these things happen."' 
I added all the black people that I knew and I told them to add all the black people that they knew.All of a sudden we were a club that then formalized into not just about recruiting, but we wanted to attract, we wanted to introduce people to the concept 
of working in tech, we wanted to retain people, we wanted to build community. 
The India team used to approve all the ads that showed up on Google and it's literally a person that had to go: "Yes, no, yes, no." And finally, we were teaching the machine to do: "Yes, no, yes, no." But at some point, there's just some judgment about what's on this page that the machine just can't learn. You assume that all automation is possible, and when you're sitting in Silicon Valley, you have that mindset that everything can and should be automated, and our entire lives will be more efficient because of it, and that was the moment when we learned that there has to be some human judgment somewhere in society. Otherwise, we will make bad decisions. We talk a lot about technology teaching us how to be smarter, but I still believe that there's human beings who just teach technology how to be smarter. I think that's an important concept that we took later to TaskRabbit. I was stubborn. I had my own way of doing things. I'm a very organized person and so I would show up at my one-on-ones... ​And I'd have the 10 things that I wanted to accomplish and then I'd get through the first one and feel frustrated that we didn't get through the nine other things. I had that same meeting with the same person the next week and just get more and more frustrated, but what I needed to learn, faster than I learned at that time, was that this meeting is not about you, Stacy. This meeting is about the person that you're leading, and that person needs to talk for 25 minutes in the 30-minute meeting in order to be effective in their job. Seeing more of what I needed to do to help others be successful, than what I needed to do to be successful, I had to get hit over the 
head with that many, many times before it worked. I looked around and I was in an office, two floor-to-ceiling windows. My dog at the time was there, had his own bed. I had a table. I had a couch. I had an assistant. I had everything that most people dream of in a corporate job, and I felt like my work wasn't done. I said, "I got to go to do something else that grabs at my heart in a way that is going to allow me to accomplish more." I'm a mission-minded person. We talk a lot in Silicon Valley about missionaries and mercenaries, and I'm definitely in the missionary bucket. Google's mission to organize the world's information was... Wow, that's huge. I could do that for the rest of my life. 
But TaskRabbit's mission around revolutionizing everyday work really grabbed me, and it 
brought me back home to Detroit. It brought me back to the people who were good, 
hard-working people who lost their jobs because of the failure of an entire industry, who 
couldn't find work but had strong work ethics, and here's this great little app that is doing that.TaskRabbit was eBay for services when I joined. Anybody can do anything, get anything that they want. It was the "Impersonate my best friend at the birthday party." This got coverage in L.A. on TV, and it's no shock it's like L.A., right? Fifty percent of the people had a bad experience, and they told 10 times more people than the people who had a good experience. That just wasn't going to work for the long term. We tested it in London because they don't know what TaskRabbit is and how it works. They've heard of it, and lots of people were in London and wanted TaskRabbit to be there, but they didn't know what the product was.The assignment rate went up, our close rate went up to over 80%, 
not 50% anymore. We knew that we were on to something, and then we brought it back 
to the U.S.We told them the same day that we told TechCrunch and USA. Today and all of our clients, everybody, and that was a mistake because they revolted, 
and they were upset, mostly because we didn't tell them that we were going to do this, 
some because some people weren't going to have work anymore, and they were going 
to have work in a different way. We knew that we were going to lose money the day after we made this decision. We didn't know for how long before the recovery would happen. For the 
period where we think that we are going to be in this slump before we recover, we're 
going to have to all be okay, as a leadership team, that this is happening, and nobody 
can fake. Nobody. I'm really glad that we stuck to our guns, but it took a lot of courage 
for us to do that, and the lesson there is, you've got to have a plan if things don't work 
out, but you've got to be willing to stick to the plan, because sometimes it will, and most times it will. The community of Taskers, they really take pride in the work that they do. Everybody seeks to get better at something. I might be naïve in saying that, but 
all of us seek to get better at something. We've actually harnessed the power of the community to do a lot of the training and development. If I want to learn how to drill a hole in a brick wall, I can charge $5 more per hour, and so someone organizes a virtual session or a live session, I can go to that. Drill holes into brick walls, how to mount a TV with the wires hidden, trampolines, Christmas toys. In fact, I got one, which is like a little car, for my kids, and they'll teach each other about the tricks and tips on how to do that. As you can imagine, there are extremely good Ikea furniture assemblers on TaskRabbit who can put things together in like 20 minutes that would take two hours. I remember there was a Tasker who came to my house to fix a light switch recently, and he said, "You know, I remember you," and I thought he was going to remember me as the CEO of the company, but he had delivered a birthday cake and flowers for me like two years before to a restaurant. And I said, "How did you go from delivering cake to light electrical work?" He said, "Because of the TaskRabbit community. I've always been interested in fidgeting with things. I've gone to some classes, I learned, and now I'm making like twice as much as I was making on the platform because of TaskRabbit." You can't quantify the impact of what that is, and the power of community, but it's really 
helped, we've created this self-enabling way for people to learn and earn in the 
marketplace. A lot of what we're trying to do with the future of work is make it very 
easy for people to access work opportunities. Inside of TaskRabbit, what about the app 
experience can we do to make it so that someone who doesn't have a high school 
education or a college degree can easily download this app, enter in some information 
about themselves and be ready to accept and decline work? So we're spending a lot of 
time thinking about: how do we make this technology simpler? How do we make 
TaskRabbit more accessible to more people and more affordable? It used to be that at our current hourly rates, my mom would not have been able to use TaskRabbit because she just would have looked at that and said, "This is too expensive, and I'd rather just do it myself and sleep less, or fall asleep while I'm helping you with your homework,” which happened, “because I can't afford this service."
