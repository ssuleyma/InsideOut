​KEVIN SYSTROM:​
I decided my junior year, I wanted to study abroad, and honestly I didn't like languages, but I picked Italian because I was told it was the easiest to pick up, 
but I fell in love with it and I wasn't terrible at it. I got pretty good. And I was like, “Yeah, I want to go to Italy and I love coffee and art.” 
 
​It was like the exact lens you want to use with the sharpest glass that you
could get.  

 My professor Charlie looks at me with my camera – which is, I think an embodiment of my personality of perfection – and he looked at me and he was like, "No, 
no, no. Like you're not here to do perfection. Give me that."  
 
So I did and I thought he was going to tweak with the settings and then he went into the 
other room came back with a plastic camera. He's like, "You're not allowed to use your 
camera for the next three months." And I had like, saved for this thing. So he gives me 
this camera and I'm like looking at it, it's like a toy camera. 

​ If you haven't seen a Holga, it's like a toy camera. It's got a plastic lens and 
like, light leaks into the side of it if you're not careful. He's like, "You have to learn to love imperfection." 

​I started taking pictures on the go, when I was around Florence and I would 
bring it back and he would show me how to develop these photos and they were square, 
first of all, but they were like slightly blurry and slightly artistic and then he showed me how to add chemicals to the development bath so that it could actually tone the black 
and white photo with different colors.  
 
So if you're listening to this and, you know, Instagram, you see a connection. Right? Like 
square photos and filtering photos. 

​If you go back to my profile and scroll all the way back, I mean, it's blurry, it 
looks like they're a light leaks, et cetera, and two and two just came together. I think the best products are usually built based on personal experience from your past and you 
never know exactly what parts of your past will come together to form that puzzle and be 
a product that you want to build for the world, but inevitably something from your past 
triggers a memory and you say, "You know what, people might just like that." 
​I can neither confirm nor deny the allegations. But let's say it was true... 
​Hypothetically speaking. At my boarding school, I was really into music and 
radio and deejaying. I had two turntables and I loved electronic music back when 
electronic music was really uncool. And I still remember all the kids looking at me like, 
"What are you listening to?" I was really into the idea of broadcasting music and having a 
relationship with a community of listeners and this was before internet radio was like 
really a thing. Although honestly that probably would have been a better idea. 
 
​So, literally out of my dorm room, I hung this like big steel antenna on the 
roof whenever I went live and hooked it up to my turntables and started playing music 
that no one liked. It was so fun because I remember like the next day talking to 
someone, "They're like oh yeah 89.3, that was great for the one hour you went on." 

I also got to go to these clubs and actually sit in the DJ booth watching people do the thing, but I was like 16 in a 21-plus place and I behaved myself, I promise, 
mom and dad, and I did. I was a goody two shoes. 

​ I, you know, it's all connected, which is, you know, when I did sports as a kid 
I was the goalie; when I played baseball, I was the pitcher. I always wanted to be in the 
center of it and not controlling it, but I wanted to be in the center of it and the DJ is kind of the same thing, right? So, the early glimmers of, I think, wanting to start a company and lead people in a specific direction, sure like that relates a lot to, whether you're the goalie the pitcher or the DJ, you're in these types of positions.  
 
​The next two years at Google were so influential for the rest of my life 
because I saw people working hard, building products that sometimes worked, 
sometimes didn't, but I saw the process of building.  

​I was complaining, "Hey, like the market crashed. We're not buying any 
companies. What should I do?" And one of my coworkers was like, “You should pick up 
golf.” And like un-ironically, just like looked at me and was like, “Learn to love golf." At that very moment in my head, it was like, "Ding. You're leaving." I was just like, “I'm 25 or -6 or whatever”, like “I'm too young to go pick up golf.” 

​ NextStop was so influential because number one, I was a marketing guy 
there, like they asked me to join as basically marketing and growth. Like, how could we grow the service? I was pretty bad at that actually, like I'm not sure I ever helped grow it. I tried, I really did.  

​ I had this idea that Mafia Wars would be great in the real world. Like instead 
of fighting for territory in the digital domain, like imagine like, taking over a pizza parlor 
digitally or taking over, you know your favorite bar because you checked in a few times. 
You could join families and war against each other and that's why it was called Burbn, 
because it was supposed to be like speakeasies 1920s, whatever. 
 
It turns out, like I wasn't good enough to build all of the gaming features. So it was just a check-in service and I gave it to my friends and they started using it. 
 
One of the VCs was like, "Hey, like I'll give you money to do this but you have to find a co-founder." I was like, "What, like I can do this, like I'm ..." He's like, "No, 
no, no, like all companies I fund, you have to have a co-founder."  
​We just hit it off. He's one of the nicest guys I know, super humble but so sharp. I think we've just had a compatible work relationship for the last eight years, but it 
all started then and we took a bet on each other.  

​ We worked on Burbn, our friends liked it but no one else like that. And I'm 
like, looking back, I'm actually surprised anyone gave us money to work on this idea. 

I think it was about trying to have a clear story to tell people when we were introducing it to them. I like to say, like, products that do too many things that aren't 
adjacent, like how do you explain, like if you're going to tell a friend about a cool new 
service that does all these things like, how do you explain it to them? 
We rented a little room in a bed and breakfast and I was working on Burbn 
at the time and we were pivoting to photos but she was like, "I don't think I'm going to 
ever use this app." I was like, "Why not?" She's like, "Well, my photos aren't good." And I was like, "Well, that's fine. You can post photos. It'll be good." And she goes, "Well, 
they're not as good as your friend Greg's." I was like, "Well, Greg filters all his photos." and she looks at me and she's like, "Well, you should add filters then." I was like, "Ah, you're right. I should add filters." 

​I went back to the bed and breakfast room and with a dial up connection to 
Mexico, of all places, I was looking up code on how to change colors and photos, and I 
made the first filter there on the spot. It's still in the app, called X-Pro 2. 

​Many years later when I looked at the idea of having this kind of like not so 
great iPhone 3G camera, I mean, back in the day I was kind of blurry, effectively like a 
toy digital camera and I was like, you know, the goal here isn't to make this beautiful, the goal is to like deal with the imperfection. So that's like honestly where the inspiration came from.  

​Any person we gave it to, their eyes lit up because they were like, "Oh, like 
my photos seem so much better now." And that was the moment when we realized, "We 
think we have something.” 

I remember hearing from people. They're like, "Wow, I just got a like." And I was like, "Yeah, because it's a network." And they're like, "Oh, I didn't realize that. I 
thought it was just a camera app." 

​We had Tumblr, Posterous, Twitter, Facebook, I'm trying to remember the other one's, Foursquare, I think. 
The problem is that you have this app that's a network, but no one's on the 
network and it only becomes useful once people are on the network. So you have to 
have what we called the “single player mode” feel awesome. And it turns out single 
player mode is a app where you could take a photo filter it and share it to many networks 
at once, that was utility in “single player mode”, like no one else needed to use 
Instagram at the time to make that useful. It was a tool for you.  
 
But if we wanted to get lots of people downloading it, they'd have to see the photos, the 
output. And it just turns out the square photo and the borders and the links to Instagram 
were calling cards, which effectively said, "If you like what you see, you too can go do 
this exact thing, download this app." 
​
​So we went out, we got all these influencers who are photographers and 
designers to sign up and I think we had 100 people sign up, and the day we launched, 
they started posting all their photos to Twitter and to Facebook and we figured out the 
viral loop to help it grow and it just exploded. 

​ I called up my friend Adam D'Angelo who was CTO at Facebook, I think he 
had left at that point, but he knew how to scale a very large service or at least a service of our scale. 
 
Every time I hear that ringtone today it literally makes my insides turn. 
Because like the number of times our servers would go down at 2:00 am or I'd have to 
step out of a birthday party or miss a concert whatever like, too many to count. So, I now 
have a mild form of PTSD with that specific sound. 
 
It's the only true, I think, fight Mike and I have ever had, which was: we were scaling and he was like, "We're going to need another server." And I was like, "No, we don't." And it was because, I don't know, I was really cost-conscious and like it was going to be 
expensive to start up a new one. I mean not expensive in today's terms but, I remember 
that was the one really big disagreement we had and it lasted about a minute and then 
we’d calm down and I was like, "You're right."  

​ This is painful to relive. Mostly because I look back and our lives for those 
first two years would have been so much better had we just hired. I love leverage and I 
love, you know, the fact that we were able to scale a service with 13 people. I mean, we 
were like, on average, like six people for that first year, we only hired up to 13 right 
before we got acquired. So, whenever people are like, “Oh, 13.” I'm like, “Actually it was 
more like five or six.” Our lives would have been a lot easier. So lesson number one is 
find great people that know their stuff because there are a lot of them in the world and 
they would be happy to deal with the problems that you're currently facing. That is the 
lesson number one of growing a company. 

​ The decision to sell was mostly about whether or not we were aligned in our 
vision of Instagram and I think Mark and I both saw at the time that Instagram was a 
special thing. It wasn't going to be like, "Oh, we'll buy this thing and it'll just be Facebook 
Photos." Like, “We’ll rebrand it as Facebook Photos.” 
 
It's a unique community and had a unique angle and he wanted to invest in it. And that's 
the way I look at it, it’s kind of like we switched investors and we had a new board and 
that board became some of the smartest technologists that Silicon Valley had, which 
was the Facebook management team. 
​
​ We had a pretty broken infrastructure, because it was duct taped along the 
way and I don't regret that at all, like we had to duct tape it along the way, but we spent the first month or so stabilizing. It turns out stabilizing helps growth, because it's more stable people enjoy it more, people can sign up more reliably.  

​ And I believe they had pioneered this, was the growth accounting formula, 
which is okay like your net growth on any given day, you can break it up into separable 
parts: It's how many new people came in the door, how many people decided to stop 
using you, and then how many people who used to use you decided to use you again. 
Plain and simple, those three terms equal net growth. 

​There were a bunch of those critical numbers early on that then we kind of 
started to instrument and realize, “You know what, like what percent of users get this 
number of followers in the first week?” And we could track that and then ask ourselves, 
"Hey, how do we drive more followers to people and how do we make sure that new 
users get enough engagement on their first few posts?" Without measurement, you're 
kind of wandering around in the dark and you're not able to produce something that has 
product market fit. 

​Our first value meeting, when we read out our values, the first one on the list 
is keep it simple. When we started Instagram we went from solving three or four things to 
solving one really well and we saw that pay off in spades. And I think the hard part is 
when you grow a service and let's say you have hundreds of millions of people using it, 
you have varying use cases. You have varying stakeholders: some are businesses, 
some are celebrities, some are video stars, and some are creatives. You have pets on 
Instagram, right? Like how do you keep it simple when you have so many people use it? 

​So when we added video to Instagram, that was a big move. That's an 
evolution of how people were already using it stories. Same thing. Messaging, people do 
it all the time in comments. So adding complexity is okay as long as you don't add 
orthogonal use cases that feel totally unrelated. When we do that, we typically launched 
separate apps or we consider doing that. 
 
But I think it's important not to just like not build features. I think it's important just to think 
about the number of use cases that you have and ask yourself: are you keeping those in 
a limited set? 

​ Far too many times entrepreneurs assume that things aren't reversible. Jeff 
Bezos talks about one-way doors. He likes employees to make decisions quickly when 
there are two-way doors or revolving doors. But when there are one-way doors, think 
long and hard. And I think often people confuse one-way doors and two-way doors. 

​If you don't change the service, I think the world changes underneath you 
and you become less relevant. So the lesson is to not, not change the service, but rather 
what do you change it to? And when you change it, how do you keep it feeling simple?
