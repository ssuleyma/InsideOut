DANIEL EK:​
​There's something called the allemansrätten and its literally translation is 
"everyman's right" and this comes at the core of Swedish. For instance, if you own a 
piece of property in Sweden, people are allowed to walk your property. If the property is 
large enough, they're actually even allowed to tent at your property for 24 hours. ​
​This notion of “private versus public” just doesn't exist to the same extent. Like all 
income is public in Sweden, like every single one. I think that, plus the fact that it's such a small society, means that the number one thing the whole society is built on is trust, like you can't screw people over. You have to honor your agreements. 
​It's one of those weird families, like in normal families, you would get a college 
degree and that would be the important thing, not really in our family. In fact, no one had a college degree, but having a music education was super important. 
​In Sweden, where I grew up, there's actually free music education, which I think 
explains a lot about how music is so big in that country and why it's such a big export for us as well. You get taken to this place when you're about four or five years old, and you walk around and you get to sample every instrument you can imagine. I walked around 
and I saw people playing piano, I saw people doing the flute, I saw people doing all sorts 
of things. In one of the rooms was this person who was playing the drums. I saw that and 
I was like, "Holy shit, this is amazing. I really want to play the drums." 
​My parents, because I wasn't really that into music at that time and nor did I really ​
want to do it, they said you can pick any instrument you want. "I want to play the drums." 
They said, "Well any instrument you want… but the drums, because we were living in an 
apartment and we didn't want to get evicted." 
He had told me that I should pick the guitar because if I pick the guitar, I could 
actually have a shot with the girls. As a five-year-old, I didn't know what "have a shot 
with the girls" actually meant, but I thought he was a pretty cool guy, so I ended up 
playing guitar. That's the story of how I started picking up the guitar. 
No, it wasn't really any connection between the two. It was a C64.  
​Yes, with a cassette, indeed.​ ​Then one day, the cassette broke. The actual player 
broke down. I started deconstructing the player and figured out how to fix it. Next time 
the computer broke down, I took it apart, and then put it back together again and fixed it.Got a bit overconfident so at one point, I asked someone who was an engineer, “What's 
the hardest thing to learn?" The person said, "Well, C++ is probably the hardest thing to 
learn."  
​By age nine, probably I thought, "Hey, I'm going to learn how to program C++." And 
about 40 pages of code later, I could construct the mouse cursor that moved around, 
which felt like a lot of work for something relatively simple. 
​Yeah, about 1997, people had started talking about web pages. And in Sweden at 
least, it was kind of the craze that everyone should have a web page. So one day, there 
was someone who asked me if I could create a web page for them. I didn't know how to 
do HTML and I certainly didn't know how to do anything in design. My instinct was to say 
no. The person kept coming back and asking me again if I can do it. About the third time 
the person asked, I decided to just take an absurd number that I can think of just to 
make sure I get rid of the person. I said, "Well, sure I'll do it, but I want $5,000 to do it." The person said, "Done." I'm like, "Oh, holy shit, I now actually have to learn how to do this." ​
​Fast forward, I'm now like in later stages in elementary school. I had all the people 
in my class that were good at math and I taught them how to do HTML for me and the 
people that were really good at design, I taught them Photoshop. I was basically running 
an illegal sweatshop, when I was 14. That was the start of my entrepreneurial career. 
What I started off doing was I bought the TV I wanted, I bought the guitars that I wanted, and I even got the computer that I wanted. Eventually, I ran out of things to buy. 
​The pivotal moment when I realized that I wanted to work with the internet 
specifically, not just as a software developer, was the first time I tried Napster.  
​For me, it was like really an epiphany because up until that point, the internet was 
mostly about text and maybe some blinking GIFs. All of a sudden came this Napster 
thing, which enabled you to get access to the entire world's music. For someone who's 
really into music, it was phenomenal. I've discovered so much great music from it. When 
it got shut down, I figured that you can't put the genie back in the bottle, so something 
like it must exist. 
I thought long and hard about what I was passionate about and what made me get 
into technology to begin with. Funnily enough, I took a stint off for a few months and just 
played guitar, like on the road with various Swedish artists. I was doing more soul 
searching than anything else.  
What came back to me was I had these two passions in life: music and technology. It 
started dawning upon myself: why haven't anyone fixed this? Why haven't anyone made 
the Napster thing work, both for consumers and work for artists as well? 
​Yeah. I was just really naive to be honest then. Like many other entrepreneurs, I 
didn't understand nearly enough what it would take to get this to work. It really started 
with just being your own customer in the sense that I had this idea of the kind of product 
that I wanted to see in the world. The way I articulated that to my team was: what if we 
can build something that makes it feel like we had all the world's music on your hard 
drive? If we can create that feeling, we would have built something that's much better 
than piracy, so we're going to get people to consume it. The second part of that 
equation, in order to not get shut down is obviously, it has to work for artists.  
​If we can create that feeling, we would have built something that's much better than piracy.
​The speed thing was something that I obsessively focused on. 
I read in this book that the human brain takes about 200 milliseconds to perceive 
anything, like at all. I said to the engineering team, we gotta get this down to 200 
milliseconds. At that time, that was 2006, that was considered crazy. 
​We never got it down to 200 milliseconds consistently. We got it down to about half a second but when you play then with things such as the throbber... 
​ …and you actually, cognitively make it move even before there's sound, the human 
brain perceives it to be instant even though technically, it wasn't. There's a lot of things that you could do, and I got really into the details there of just creating an amazing experience that solved the end goal. I think I was very clear from the beginning that this needed to feel like you had all the world's music on your hard drive. Meeting 
entrepreneurs today, I would say, it's very rare that I hear someone who can articulate 
what the end status of that product that they're trying to build, we realized if you do solve that, that's going to be a huge thing. 
​My thinking was, well, up until that point, Napster and everyone else just haven't 
shared any of the revenues, so I'm sure we can figure out a fairly straightforward 
revenue share deal with the music industry, and they'll be happy because they get more than what they're getting now. Obviously, it turned out that it wasn't that easy. 
​Yeah. It was really, really tough. I essentially told them, "Hey, you should really give 
away all your music for free over here and make it legal because eventually, people will 
start paying for the product." Not very surprisingly that wasn't a very convincing story to tell. 
​If you looked at Sweden, at that time, I think, it had lost more than 80% of its entire 
revenue base. It was really in shambles. Going from the beginning where I try to get 
everything in all markets and realizing that that wasn't going to work, I decided to shift 
strategy and instead take a very narrow market, where they lost most of it and said, 
"Look, why don't I prove this to you and take it to my own home country?" I essentially 
told them like, “I guarantee you one years' worth of revenue in that market if you enable 
this business model." 
I kept being really surprised by how lukewarm everyone ended up being on the 
other side. I was starting to second guess my own enthusiasm about the space. And I 
remember, specifically, I was on one of these major label's retreats​ ​and my pitch was 
“We're entering the golden age of music.”  And there wasn’t a single person applauding 
anything I said. They just looked completely shocked. I walked off stage and there was 
like this one guy that came up and said, "Oh, it was a really interesting speech. This is 
the first time anyone said anything positive today." There had been in such a long 
sequential decline that anyone seeing anything different was just unbelievable.   ​
​This is a community where people have known each other for 20 plus years. If you'd 
only been there for like 10 or 15, you're kind of a newcomer, like maybe you'll be around, 
maybe you won't. I'm still a bit considered the outsider, but what I realized was when I 
started getting included in the conversations that they were having, that's when the 
general acceptance started happening. And that's where we could build mutual trust and 
start working together on what I think will be kind of the next level of growth for the 
company, where music in and of itself will change. 
​At the end of the day, it’s about trust and if you say that what you're going to do and 
then keep on doing that, you will do pretty well. If you think about what we're now trying 
to do as a public company, it's exactly that. I didn't realize it but it's been quite a cultural shock for even Wall Street to start realizing, and I'm hoping that they'll get to it and eventually start trusting us.
