Due to a long distance relationship and a bad bowl of pasta I was in 
my dorm room on a Friday night. And I told myself, “If anyone else mails you about 
another job, you just have to pick. You have 13 good offers, you just have to pick one.” 
It came in late on this Friday night, it said, "Work at Google" and I remember 
looking down and being like, "This bowl of pasta is so bad, and I am so pathetic that I'm here on a Friday night eating bad pasta." 
I accidentally hit the spacebar, which in my email reader program opened the 
message. I looked back up, and it was open, and I realized it was actually an email from Salar Kamangar, another early Googler, who said, "I've been talking to different professors at Stanford about who I should be talking to that's graduating, your name came up."   
I went up to his apartment in San Francisco and said, "I've got all these offer 
letters..." And we pulled all the different values for all of the different columns off of these offer letters: salary, stock, where it was, career trajectory, promotion ability, happiness quotients. Andre just loves working on problems like that, and he turned to me and said, "This has been really fun. Thank you so much for involving me in this." I was like, "I haven't made a decision, this hasn't been fun for me at all. I'm completely overwhelmed!” So he’s like, “Go to bed, sleep on it, the first thing you think of tomorrow morning, whether you can articulate it or not, that's the right decision." That is how I ultimately picked Google. I went to sleep, I woke up the next morning, and I just wanted to work at Google. For a lot of the reasons I could articulate and for a bunch of other reasons that were harder to articulate. I felt like the smartest people were there and I felt really unprepared to try and do what they wanted to do overall as a company. They were really ambitious. For all those reasons, I picked it. I like to be really data-driven, but I don't ignore the human instinct element of it. For me, my process is, a lot of times, roll around in the data, get to know it and really understand it really well, and then make a gut-based call, which is often supported by data and a lot of hard-to-articulate factors as well. Totally, yes. 
We actually had the job description up for four months and we failed to find 
anyone. Interviewed a bunch of people, but frankly at that point, everyone else's start up was more promising than Google. It was very hard to extract people from other companies. 
He said, "I looked at everyone's resumes and you have this thing in your 
background about cognitive psychology, and how people learn and think. You're 
probably our closest match, so I want you to start spending one day a week doing front end stuff. You just need to make these decisions and start implementing them." He was like, "I'm not putting you in this role for your artistic judgment or your design background." My mother was an art teacher, but I don't have a lot of design in my background. He was like, "Basically, get data." questions that were plaguing Google’s engineers. Why is this font gray? Why are we still using serifs? Why is this here? What would happen if we added a bigger margin?
​I went about reading everything I could about fonts. It turns out, for example, 
sans serif fonts are more legible, serif fonts are more readable. You're like, what's the difference? 
​It turns out legibility is the ability to recognize the single character. It turns out without serifs in the way, you can actually spot read much faster. With serifs, they guide your eye along the road, the text, so they're sort of meant to create a track that your eye follows. 
We had enough home grown technology at Google, and it worked sufficiently 
differently from other systems, that we needed somebody who could help them 
understand: How do I push this into production? How do I take this live? How do I 
actually launch it, make sure all the components are up and ready to go? 
He was like, "All these companies, they kind of look like we do except they all have this thing called product management, which we don't really have." 
“But what we do have is we have Salar, Susan, and Marissa…” 
That’s Salar Kamangar and Susan Wojcicki, who’s now CEO of YouTube. 
​“...who all tend to do things kind of all across the company. Their job titles don't 
really fit what they do, so they're kind of our product managers.” And then they were like, “Wait, you're a software engineer, but you're doing all this feature specification and testing and helping people launch all of the procedural elements, working with marketing and PR and everybody so they know this new thing is going to appear, customer care." That is right in the sweet spot of product management. We just didn't know that that's what we were really doing. 
"I wanna bet that I can hire new people right out of school and train them to be great product managers at Google faster than you can hire the people you prefer who 
are more experienced and senior." I was like, "I'm gonna go to Stanford and MIT. I'm gonna look for well-trained computer scientists who also understand how to apply technology. I'm gonna bring them in, give them really big jobs because we have really big jobs here in the product management group that aren't filled, and we'll just do what kind of happened to Salar and me. Larry and Sergei, at times, just kind of yelled at us until we did what they needed us to do and rose to the occasion. I'm hoping to do that with less yelling." 
We brought them in and gave them these huge jobs. They had to have been some of the most stressed out bunches of 22- and 23-year-olds in the world. 
The APMs, they would always be like, "No, I don't want to rotate." I said, "Look, 
Google is a really unique place because you can try three or four different formats of product management in one place. You can do nascent products. You can do mature 
products. You can do mobile. There were all these different types of product 
management, and usually to get that breadth of experience, you'd have to change 
companies, which is a far scarier move.” The nice thing for them is it gave them that flexibility without taking the leap of changing jobs. 
​I would basically say a rotation is anything that can suffice the Mad Lib: "I used 
to do 'x' and now I'm going to do 'y' and by making this change, I'm going to learn 'z.'" You can say things like, "I used to adwords, now I'm moving onto search. By making this change, I'm going to learn the difference between having advertisers as my users versus consumers as my users." 
They formed this network and it’s seeing the connections between things. One of the things we saw starting to happen at Google is that the APMs, because of that 
network, could get done things that no one else could get done. They would be sitting there in the room with our engineers, and the engineers would be like, "I need machines." 
The APM would be like, "How many do you need?" And they'd be like, "Four thousand?" 
Then later that day, they would show up at the engineer's desk and say like, "I got 4,000 machines for you. These are the racks they're in. They'll be coming these days." And they’d be like, "How did you do that?" Part of it was because we had an APM who was the product manager on machine allocations. They basically started to form connections between groups. 
By going across disciplines, you actually get a much more holistic pattern, but it also worked because you knew someone at YouTube, you knew somebody who was 
working in social. You knew someone who was working in machine allocation or 
infrastructure. They really started creating a really wonderful element of glue across the organization. 
I just felt like the people at yahoo hust seemed like really good, fun, nice people. Despite all the turmoil at the top, you could feel that. I think there's a bunch of good people who really wanna make this company work and wanna make the world a nicer place, a cozier place, and have fun doing it. That was really my hypothesis when I went in. I was blown away when I got there because there were so many people there with so many ideas and so much energy to try and improve the company. It was really just waiting for someone to come and really try and harness it. I remember when I first got there, someone said, "Lady, I don't even know where you're gonna start. There are thousands of things that are wrong with this place." I was like, "That's really daunting. There's thousands of things to fix?" 
​My first week at Yahoo, I made a point of going down to the cafeteria and just 
hanging out for a long time. I was in the cafeteria and this guy came up and snapped his hand on my tray. He was like, "Is it go-time?" 
I was like, "Please don't leave. I've only been here for four days. We might do something actually fun and cool." He was like, "No, I'm not talking about leaving. Is it go-time? There's a whole bunch of us that have been here for like five, 10, 15 years, waiting for the leadership and the board to figure itself out. Is it go-time? Can we actually run, do stuff, build stuff?" I was like, "Yes. By all means, run, go, do. Don't let me stop you." 
​Ultimately, as Eric Schmidt will always say, leadership is defense. He's like, 
"Look, unfortunately as an executive, you don't get to write code. You don't get to design things anymore. Your job is point the team in a direction and get everything else out of the way. Help them run and do the best work that they can do, but you've gotta clear the pathway." I had this wonderful woman, Patricia Moll Kriese, who I just called The Red Tape Machete. She sort of had jurisdiction anywhere in the company to go and talk to the person who could make the decision to just blow that up, and just be like, "That process doesn't make sense anymore. We're just gonna remove this. We're just gonna do that." 
​We created something called “PB and J”: process, bureaucracies, and jams. 
Basically, you could report process, bureaucracies, and jams that didn't make sense to you. We wanted to come up with something that was kind of catchy and memorable and an acronym. We were like, process, bureaucracy. I was like, "Well let's do jams." Patricia did a company meeting every Friday called FYI and Patricia would use the Peanut Butter Jelly Time song as her intro music when she would come up and talk 
about the different changes and things that we were gonna make as a result of “PB and J” that week. 
​We basically came up with a really scalable wisdom of crowds, like solutions to 
point us where the problems were. They were everything from like, we had a doorway on the stairwell in Bangalore that would get locked. It would make everyone walk all the way around the building to use the staircase on the other side. They were just like, "Can we just unlock the stairwell?" 
All of those types of things to just start making the company work better, but also really empowered the people there, to make them feel like: “You need to be part of the solution." 
If you could come up with an idea that could make $5 million dollars a year 
extra, we had a really amazing prize. I think it was like $250,000 per team, or $50,000 per individual. I thought we'd get maybe two dozen ideas, maybe green light six of them, get $20 or $30 million dollars of extra revenue. 
Instead, we got, I believe, 840 submissions of ideas from across the company. There 
were a lot of really amazing ideas in there. I think in the end, we greenlit almost 200 of them. We started seeing tens of millions of dollars of new revenue come through that. It's a little known fact, but for the last six quarters of Yahoo's existence prior to the sale, not only did we beat the street, we beat plan. We were starting to grow areas. We had almost $2 billion dollars of wholly new invented revenue inside the company in five years. We had bankers saying, "Look, can we take that part of the company public? The growth on that is unbelievable." 
​There were times when I even talked about my investor base was like two cats 
in a bag. I had one cat that was very interested in the internet and the operating 
business and the other sort of cat who were very interested in the Asian assets and what was going to happen with those. There really came a point where you have to let the two cats out of the bag. 
We came up with a plan to do a tax-free spin off. Simultaneously, the 
government decided to examine tax-free spin-offs. So that made some of our investors 
very nervous about the outcomes there. Ultimately, we decided we should not pursue 
that path, but instead should do what we would call the reverse spin, which was a sale of the core business, essentially leaving the Asian assets behind, getting the operating business and the Asian assets into two different entities. Basically, there came a point where the Asian assets were so big and so much of a focus of our shareholders that it really made sense to disentangle the two, which ultimately led to the sale process and the sale to Verizon. ​
Sure. I think that my summary now is, I love Yahoo. I think it would have been amazing to see it return to greatness and I think that there are some ways where we 
could have ended up with the home run outcome. That said, it would have required 
almost perfect timing. Nothing ever goes perfectly, especially with regard to timing. It's funny because I can now look back and say, "Oh, I could see somewhere where there was a really amazing outcome for the company, if just for these few decisions and points." 
At the same time, in real time, I'm not sure. With the benefit of hindsight, you can make that observation. In real time, I'm not sure that you can. I think that the team that we had at the end, both from the executives all the way down to the individual contributors – at the end, we really had the right team. 
That's what I felt like. It felt almost like an hourglass. When the first sand starts to go through it, it looks like it's never all gonna fall through, but at the end, it starts falling through really precipitously. That's internally what it felt like. In the beginning, Alibaba gave us the luxury of time, which we really needed. In the end, it really shortened that time frame. I do think if we had, with that team, with that base of revenue, with our plan, if we had had another year and we had ten quarters of beating plan, we really could have gotten there. 
In hindsight, and again hindsight is 20/20, I think it would have been helpful to continue to pursue the spin. I'm optimistic that it would have been ultimately tax-free, though it may have caused an overhang. That said, at that moment, it looked very tentative. I understand why we made the decision we made. But I do think if we'd pursued that original spin-off idea, it might have given us the year of time as an independent public company to really find our footing and start to show that growth in the operating core. It's funny because I now am back in the same office I started my career in so I get to see it, live it every day. We're almost above the bike shop on University Avenue in Palo Alto, so there's these funny stucco stairs… I am really proud of the APM program because I do think the legacy has touched so much of the industry overall. But to me, I don't want to take that achievement 
away from the APMs themselves. They're such amazing individuals, I don't feel like I get to claim credit for their achievements.
